<h1>Pacman Factory</h1>
This project includes a button that generates a Pacman with a random starting velocity that moves around the 2D space and bounces off the walls when they collide.
<h1>Roadmap</h1>
Perhaps I will make it so the Pacmen open and close their mouths like how they are animated within the game.
